Hi, my name is Oge, I specialize in Data Analysis, and with a proven track record in delivering complex projects on time in an agile environment, I have successfully managed multiple high-impact projects from Concept to Delivery through a mix of skills like Data Collection, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Experimentation & Cross-Functional Collaboration. In my previous projects as a freelance analyst within and outside Upwork, I have helped turn loosely defined problems into practical analytical solutions that have helped clients as well as built easy-to-use self-service dashboards that the non-technical stakeholders have used. I love working with smart competent people and I thrive in an environment where there is a strong sense of camaraderie within a team.
